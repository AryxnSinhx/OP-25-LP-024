ðŸ§  Mental Wellness Analysis and Support Strategy
Project.

ðŸ“Œ Objective
This project analyzes mental health in the tech industry using machine learning to:
â€¢ Classification â†’ Predict if a person is likely to seek mental health treatment.
â€¢ Regression â†’ Predict an individualâ€™s age from workplace and personal attributes.
â€¢ Unsupervised Clustering â†’ Segment employees into personas (e.g., Silent Strugglers, Supported Advocates).
An interactive Streamlit dashboard is deployed for HR teams to explore insights, simulate interventions, and flag high-risk employee groups.


ðŸ“Š Dataset
â€¢ Source: Mental Health in Tech Survey (OSMI)
â€¢ Size: ~1,500 tech professionals
â€¢ Features: 
â€¢ Demographics (age, gender, country)
â€¢ Workplace environment (mental health benefits, leave policies)
â€¢ Personal experiences (mental illness, family history)
â€¢ Attitudes towards mental health


ðŸ”Ž Project Workflow
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
â€¢ Data cleaning (removing invalid ages, gender anomalies)
â€¢ Visualizations (distribution plots, correlation heatmaps, workplace policy insights)
2. Supervised Learning
â€¢ Classification Models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM
â€¢ Regression Models: Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor
â€¢ Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, ROC-AUC, RMSE, MAE
3. Unsupervised Learning
â€¢ Algorithms: KMeans, Agglomerative Clustering, DBSCAN
â€¢ Evaluation: Silhouette Score
â€¢ Personas identified (e.g., Silent Sufferers, Open Advocates)
4. Deployment with Streamlit
â€¢ EDA Visualizations
â€¢ Prediction Form (seek treatment, predict age)
â€¢ Cluster Visualizer with persona descriptions
